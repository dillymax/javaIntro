we can use mulitiple lang in genesys 
configure->you can add languages in supported lang settings in every callflows eg:inbound , bot flow etc
how to achive ?
using set lang block 
*In inbound if we use to set lang in set lang block ,lang will change when it will reached to another task only ,withing same task it will not chnage lang
*bot flow whenever you set lang in set lang block then after the block only lang changed

RONA->ring on no answer.
TRASFER TO QUEUE
*In genesys if transfer the call to ivr to inQueue flow(QUEUE) ,first Genesys will search 
available(active agents) and who is free then genesys directly transfer the call to the agent.then wait for agent to pick the call.
how long it will be wait ?
here RONA came into the picture ,here only we are going set the time how long it will be wait for agent to pick the call.
if agents available and free meant call will be transfer to particular agent.
if agents not available and agent isn't free means following InQueue logic will be executed..

Data action in genesys pure cloud 
*we can do three different way of authentication (for O-auth purpose)
1.During Integration 
step 1: click Integration tab and click add Integration
step 2: install 'Genesys Cloud Data Actions' (for O-auth purpose)
step 3: then creandential tab click and  congifuge creandential

2.giving authentication things in headers in action
3.


Web Services Data Actions  ->custom O-Auth purpose.
Credential Type
*basic auth    ->selecting this you can giving creandential to headers in action
*user define   ->selecting this you can 
*user define o auth
Genesys Cloud Data Actions ->using genesys client and secrete id for O-Auth
